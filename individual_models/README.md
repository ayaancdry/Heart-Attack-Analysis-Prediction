This folder contains individual implementations of each model, initially explored and preprocessed in the `eda.ipynb` file, which documents the preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) steps.

Please note that the final consolidated Jupyter Notebook, which combines all models into a single workflow, is located in the `heart_attack_analysis_and_prediction.ipynb` file within the repository. Some updates have been made to the EDA section in this combined notebook, including additional visualizations and explanations to improve clarity and insight.
